# KiraleaTromblyProfessionalPortfolio

Project Purpose:

The Purpose of this project was to begin to create a professional portfolio that demonstrates the skills we have learned throughout our time at the Denver University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Thus far, these skills have included learning to use the terminal, github repositories, html, and css. 

Throughout the program this webpage will include additional links to projects we have completed. The webpage design will also be updated as my skills progress with regard to webpage development. 

This project will allow me to utilize my skils and develope a webpage of my own that will encapsulate all that I have learned through the Full Statck Program.
